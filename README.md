 Build Specs: 
- Burgundy F13 WKL Frog TKL
- SwedeEC8X 
- Topre converted Alu 5202 1.2mm plate
- YMDK Housings
- KLC Playground MX Sliders
- YMDK 2U Assemblies and 7U Assembly 
- 3mm Silencing Rings
- Realforce R1 45g Domes
- Realforce Conical Springs
- DCX WoB




## Build Guide (Needs Pictures*) 
1. Place the tadpole mounts into the plate. 
2. Slot the EC Housings and slider assemblies into the plate. 
3. Place the domes into the housings. 
4. Place the conical springs in the domes (make sure non are stacked as this causes issues). 
6. Place the pcb onto the back of the plate.
7. Place the provided Waferhead M2.5 8mm Screws into the pcb and tighten into the threaded holes found on the plate. 


## Parts required for the conversion
- Domes, EC Springs, Sliders (Topre Stem or MX), Housings, EC8X PCB, Supported Plate, M2.5 8mm Waferhead Screws. 

  - Domes, EC Springs, MX Sliders and housings can be sourced aftermarket from online vendors such as [Deskeys](https://deskeys.io), [KLC Playground](https://klc-playground.com/products/instock-ec-kits-and-packs?_pos=1&_sid=c27f2fce2&_ss=r&variant=42124616171726) and 
  [ThoccExchange](thoccexchange.com)

  - Topre stem sliders currently have no aftermarket option so will need to be harvested from a board or bought from someone who has already harvested them, these can be found in trade channels found on enthusiast discords. If you fail to find them you can simply buy a 
  realforce to harvest yourself (preferably broken as to not ruin perfectly good boards). This is also a bonus as it will give you the domes, housing, EC springs and keycaps often at a lower price than the aftermarket options.


  - Another optional part would be silencing rings, which result in a much quieter upstroke as the ring dampens the slider when returning to the top of the housing. 


> [!NOTE]
> You may upset many from harvesting perfectly good boards, so please do try and look for a Junkforce. :smile_cat:





## Layout Support

## Getting your own plates manufactured

- When looking for a manufacturer, make sure that they offer the threading as topre needs many holes on the plates in order to sandwich the pcb and plate together to ensure good contact. 



## Firmware

- If you find yourself having issues with the firmware, please message me on Discord or open an issue on here.
- Whilst waiting for the Firmware to be pushed to the main branch of VIA so the PCB is automatically recognised, you can use this [Firmware Link](https://app-6w4.pages.dev)

## Tasks left to complete 
- [X] Support all Frog TKL Layouts
- [ ] Get o-ring cutouts for next batch to allow support of all H87/H88 TKLs 
- [ ] Increase PCB support for more boards by converting plates to Topre.
- [ ] Host groupbuy for Frog TKL Plates. DM me on Discord if you would be interested (swede.)
