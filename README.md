## Build Guide
1. Place the tadpole mounts into the plate. 
2. Slot the EC Housings and slider assemblies into the plate. 
3. Place the domes into the housings. 
4. Place the conical springs in the domes (make sure non are stacked as this causes issues). 
6. Place the pcb onto the back of the plate.
7. Place the provided Waferhead M2.5x0.45 8mm Screws into the pcb and tighten into the threaded holes found on the plate. 

### Parts required for the conversion
- Domes
  - These can be sourced from online vendors such as Deskeys or KLC Playground, however many would agree that OEM is the best option. Sadly, this often means harvesting of existing EC boards such as HHKBs and Realforces - This is ideal as it also supplies you with the   
  majority of the other parts required for this build. 

> [!NOTE]
> You may upset many from harvesting perfectly good boards, so please do try and look for a Junkforce. 







#### Tasks left to complete 
- [X] Design more plates to support more Frog TKL layouts
- [ ] Get o-ring cutouts for next batch to allow support of all H87/H88 TKLs 
- [ ] Support more boards with plate files 
- [ ] Host groupbuy for Frog Plates.
