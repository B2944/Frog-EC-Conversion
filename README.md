## Build Guide (Needs Pictures*) 
1. Place the tadpole mounts into the plate. 
2. Slot the EC Housings and slider assemblies into the plate. 
3. Place the domes into the housings. 
4. Place the conical springs in the domes (make sure non are stacked as this causes issues). 
6. Place the pcb onto the back of the plate.
7. Place the provided Waferhead M2.5 8mm Screws into the pcb and tighten into the threaded holes found on the plate. 


## Parts required for the conversion
- Domes, EC Springs, Sliders (Topre Stem or MX), Housings, EC8X PCB, Supported Plate, M2.5 8mm Waferhead Screws. 

  - Domes, EC Springs, MX Sliders and housings can be sourced aftermarket from online vendors such as [Deskeys](https://deskeys.io), [KLC Playground](https://klc-playground.com/products/instock-ec-kits-and-packs?_pos=1&_sid=c27f2fce2&_ss=r&variant=42124616171726) and 
  [ThoccExchange](thoccexchange.com)

  - Topre stem sliders currently have no aftermarket option so will need to be harvested from a board or bought from someone who has already harvested them, these can be found in trade channels found on enthusiast discords. If you fail to find them you can simply buy a 
  realforce to harvest yourself (preferably broken as to not ruin perfectly good boards). This is also a bonus as it will give you the domes, housing, EC springs and keycaps often at a lower price than the aftermarket options.


> [!NOTE]
> You may upset many from harvesting perfectly good boards, so please do try and look for a Junkforce. :smile_cat:
